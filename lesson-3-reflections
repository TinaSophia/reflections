1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It allows me to work remotely on my projects when not at home, for example, or
when using a different computer. Other people can look at the code
and give suggestions or collaborate and contribute to the project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
 automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 This allows more control over what is published on GitHub.
