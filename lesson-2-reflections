1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository the .git file is created. This file will hold all
meta data associated to the history of the repository. Command to use: git init

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Files are no longer available for changes once they are added to the staging area.
The staging area is a place to hold files until I am ready to commit them.
The staging are only holds files to be committed.
The working directory includes all files associated to the project tracked and
non-tracked. Here I am actively making changes.
The repository holds the history of all commits.
